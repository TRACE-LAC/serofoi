# Use cases

## For the models defined in the *serofoi* package

**serofoi** is an R package that allows estimations of the Force-of-Infection from a population based serosurvey data.

## **Sero-survey data**

Surveys had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria:

1.  Be population-based (not hospital based)

2.  Specify individuals' age or age group

3.  Indicate diagnostic test(s) used. The current version of serofoi only applies to *IgG* antibodies)

4.  Identify the location and date (year) of sample collection

## Model assumptions

Current version of **serofoi** includes the following assumptions on the underlying biological process:

-   The Force-of-infection (FoI) is estimated using a catalytic model

-   There is no sero-reversion (from positive to negative). It means IgG antibodies are life-long duration with no waning immunity. This may not be the case for several pathogens. This feature is planned for future versions of *serofoi***.**

-   There is no age-dependency. This may not be the case for several pathogens. This feature is planned for future versions of *serofoi***.**

-   There is no impact from migration processes in the sampled population

-   There are no differences in the mortality rate of infected versus susceptible individuals

NOTE: Running the *serofoi* models for the first time on your local computer make take a few minutes while the *rstan* code is compiled locally. Afterwards, no further local compilation is needed.

# **Constant vs Time-varying** FoI models

## Constant Force-of-Infection (endemic model)

For *constant* *endemic model*, the rate of infection acquisition―rate of seroconversion―is constant over time, and infection (sero)prevalence will increase monotonically with age as cumulative exposure increases.

Denoting $n(a,t)$ the number of seropositive individuals of age $a$ at time $t$ , $N$ the serosurvey sample size, and $P(a,t)$ the underlying seroprevalence at age $a$ at time $t$, we assumed that the number of seropositive subjects follows a Binomial distribution $n(a,t)$ \~ $B(N,P(a,t))$.

For the force-of-infection (FoI) that is constant over time, denoted $\lambda$, we modelled seroprevalence for age $a$ in year $t$ (i.e. the time when the serosurvey occurred) as:

$$ P(a,t) = 1−exp(−\lambda{a})$$

The corresponding code for the constant-FoI model with binomial distribution is:

```{r model_1, include = FALSE, echo=TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
model_1 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "constant_foi_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

```

## Time-varying Force-of-Infection

For the time-varying FoI model, the FoI values are estimated from a binomial distribution. The sero-prevalence as age a can be expressed as:

$$
𝑃(𝑎,𝑡)=1−exp(−∑_{i=t-a+1}^{t}𝜆{i})
$$

Therefore, a serosurvey completed at time $t$ and including ages $a$ from {$age_{min}, age_{max}$} is informative on exposure (and FoI) between {$t, age_{max}$} and $t$.

Currently, two models within *serofoi* allow time-varying FoI, with corresponding code:

```{r model_2, include = FALSE, echo = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
model_2 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_bi",
                     n_iters = 1500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

model_3 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_log",
                     n_iters = 1500, 
                     n_thin = 2)
```

## Fitting process

Models are implemented in **RStan** using the No-U-Turn sampler, a type of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. After convergence, the best-fitting models can be selected based on the expected log predictive density for an out-of-sample data point (elpd).

## Case study 1. Chagas disease (endemic disease)

Based on the data and analysis shown in [@Cucunubá2017], we use one of the datasets for measuring the sero-prevalence of IgG antibodies against *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection in Colombia in 2007. The dataset is part of the serofoi package as `chagas2007`.

```{r data_chagas, include = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
chagas2007 <- readRDS("../data/chagas2007.RDS") # This can be removed once data is incorporated
head(chagas2007, 5)

```

After preparring the data we can run the three different models available on serofoi, one constant and two time-varying model.

```{r three models, include = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE }

chagas2007p <- prepare_data(chagas2007)

m1_cha <- run_model(model_data = chagas2007p,
                     model_name = "constant_foi_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

m2_cha <- run_model(model_data = chagas2007p,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

m3_cha <- run_model(model_data = chagas2007p,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_log",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)


```

Now, we can plot the results of the three models to compare

```{r, model_comp_veev, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1_cha <- plot_model(m1_cha, size_text = 15)
p2_cha <- plot_model(m2_cha, size_text = 15)
p3_cha <- plot_model(m3_cha, size_text = 15)

plot_seroprev_models_grid(p1_cha, p2_cha, p3_cha, n_row = 1, n_col = 3)
```

## Case study 2. Hidden Alphaviruses epidemics in Panama

As showin in [@Carrera2020], hidden epidemic and endemic transmission of alphaviruses in Eastern Panama have been around for decades. From this paper we use a dataset measuring IgG againts Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) in a rural village in Panamá in 2017. This dataset, `veev2017` is included in serofoi.

```{r data_veev, include = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }

veev2012 <- readRDS("../data/veev2012.RDS")
head(veev2012, 5)

```

```{r models_veee, include = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE }

veev2012p <- prepare_data(veev2012)

m1_veev <- run_model(model_data = veev2012p,
                     model_name = "constant_foi_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

m2_veev <- run_model(model_data = veev2012p,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

m3_veev <- run_model(model_data = veev2012p,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_log",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)
```

Now, we can plot the results of the three models to compare. On Figure 3, we can observe a large increase in the estimated FOI. As suggested in @Carrera2020, an important increase in the transmission of VEEV in this region is inferred. Although the three fitted models converge well, we see much larger support for a more sudden increase in recent years, rather than a slow increase over decades.

```{r, model_comp_veev, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1_veev <- plot_model(m1_veev, size_text = 10)
p2_veev <- plot_model(m2_veev, size_text = 10)
p3_veev <- plot_model(m3_veev, size_text = 10)

plot_seroprev_models_grid(p1_veev, p2_veev, p3_veev, n_row = 1, n_col = 3)

```

## Case study 3. A known Large Chikungunya epidemic in Brazil

Chikungunya outbreaks ocurred rapidly after the introduction of the virus to Brazil in 2013-2014. We use the dataset from [@dias2018] that conducts a population-based study through household interviews and serologic surveys (measuring IgG antibodies against Chikungunya virus) in Bahia, Brazil during October-December 2015, right after a large CHIKV epidemic that occurred in that area.

```{r data_veev, include = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }

chik2015 <- readRDS("../data/chik2015.RDS")
head(chik2015, 5)

```

```{r models_veee, include = TRUE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE }

chik2015p <- prepare_data(chik2015)

mod1_chik <- run_model(model_data = chik2015p,
                     model_name = "constant_foi_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

mod2_chik <- run_model(model_data = chik2015p,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_bi",
                     n_iters = 1500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

mod3_chik <- run_model(model_data = chik2015p,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_log",
                     n_iters = 1500, 
                     n_thin = 2)
```

In Figure 4, we can observe the comparison between the three serofoi models. Here serofoi shows strong statistical support for a sudden increase in the transmission of CHIKV close to the year of the serosurvey (2015). The exact year is not possible to estimate, mainly given the data used is aggregated by 20-years age groups. Despite that, the results are consistent with the empirical evidence shown by [@dias2018] with both interviews, and IgM.

```{r, model_comp_chik, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1_chik <- plot_model(mod1_chik, size_text = 10)
p2_chik <- plot_model(mod2_chik, size_text = 10)
p3_chik <- plot_model(mod3_chik, size_text = 10)

plot_seroprev_models_grid(p1_chik, p2_chik, p3_chik, n_row = 1, n_col = 3)

```
