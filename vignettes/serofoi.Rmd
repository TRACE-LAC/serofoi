# Use cases for the models defined in the *serofoi* package

**serofoi** is an R package that allows estimations of the Force-of-Infection from a population based serosurvey data.

## **Sero-survey data**

Surveys had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria:

1.  Be population-based (not hospital based)

2.  Specify individuals' age or age group

3.  Indicate diagnostic test(s) used. The current version of serofoi only applies to *IgG* antibodies)

4.  Identify the location and date (year) of sample collection

## Model assumptions

Current version of **serofoi** includes the following assumptions on the underlying biological process:

-   The Force-of-infection (FoI) is estimated using a catalytic model

-   There is no sero-reversion (from positive to negative). It means IgG antibodies are life-long duration with no waning immunity. This may not be the case for several pathogens. This feature is planned for future versions of **serofoi.**

-   There is no age-dependency. This may not be the case for several pathogens. This feature is planned for future versions of **serofoi.**

-   There is no impact from migration processes in the sampled population

-   There are no differences in the mortality rate of infected versus susceptible individuals

NOTE: Running the the *serofoi* models for the first time on your local computer make take a few minutes while the *rstan* code is compiled locally. Afterwards, no further compilation is needed locally.

## **Constant vs Time-varying** FoI models

#### Constant Force-of-Infection (endemic model)

For *constant* *endemic model*, the rate of infection acquisition―rate of seroconversion―is constant over time, and infection (sero)prevalence will increase monotonically with age as cumulative exposure increases.

Denoting $n(a,t)$ the number of seropositive individuals of age $a$ at time $t$ , $N$ the serosurvey sample size, and $P(a,t)$ the underlying seroprevalence at age $a$ at time $t$, we assumed that the number of seropositive subjects follows a Binomial distribution $n(a,t)$ \~ $B(N,P(a,t))$.

For the force-of-infection (FoI) that is constant over time, denoted $\lambda$, we modelled seroprevalence for age $a$ in year $t$ (i.e. the time when the serosurvey occurred) as:

$$ P(a,t) = 1−exp(−\lambda{a})$$

The corresponding code for the constant-FoI model is:

```{r model_1, include = FALSE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
model_1 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "constant_foi_bi",
                     n_iters = 500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

```

#### Time-varying Force-of-Infection

For the time-varying FoI model, the FoI values are estimated from a binomial distribution. The sero-prevalence as age a can be expressed as:

$$𝑃(𝑎,𝑡)=1−exp(−∑_{i=t-a+1}^{t}𝜆{i})$$

Therefore, a serosurvey completed at time $t$ and including ages $a$ from {$age_{min}, age_{max}$} is informative on exposure (and FoI) between {$t, age_{max}$} and $t$.

Currently, two models within *serofoi* allow time-varying FoI, with corresponding code:

```{r model_2, include = FALSE, errors = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
model_2 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_bi",
                     n_iters = 1500, 
                     n_thin = 2)

model_2 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_log",
                     n_iters = 1500, 
                     n_thin = 2)
```

## Fitting process

Models are implemented in **RStan** using the No-U-Turn sampler, a type of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. After convergence, the best-fitting models can be selected based on the expected log predictive density for an out-of-sample data point (elpd).
