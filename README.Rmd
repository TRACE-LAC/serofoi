## *serofoi* <img src="man/figures/serofoi-logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

An R package to estimates the *Force-of-Infection* of a given pathogen from population
based sero-prevalence studies on a Bayesian framework.

## Installation
You can install the **development version** of `serofoi` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TRACE-LAC/serofoi")
```

## Quick start



```{r example, include = FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("TRACE-LAC/serofoi", ref = "dev-webrd")
library(serofoi)

```

These examples illustrate some of the current functionalities:

# The package provides an example dataset of a serosurvey `mydata`


``` {r ex, include = TRUE}

head(mydata)

# Prepare the data for using serofoi

data_test <- prepare_data(mydata)


# Current version of the package runs three different models of the FoI

# Constant Force-of-Infection with a binomial distribution
model_0 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "constant_foi_bi")

# Time-varying Force-of-Infection with a prior normal-binomial distribution
model_1 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_bi")

# Time-varying Force-of-Infection with a prior normal-log distribution
model_2 <- run_model(model_data = data_test,
                     model_name = "continuous_foi_normal_log")

# The following function can be used to visualize the sero-prevalence data with its corresponding binomial confidence interval before fitting to a model
plot_seroprev(data_test, size_text = 6)

# For each model, you can use ploting functions such as


# You can compare these three models based on convergence, elpd and p-values
comp_table <- get_comparison_table(
  model_objects_list = c(m0 = model_0,
                         m1 = model_1,
                         m2 = model_2))





```

### Lifecycle
This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that essential
features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the package is not ready
for use outside of the development team.
